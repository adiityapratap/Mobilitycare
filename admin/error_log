    [text] => When not in use, the Smart Lifter LC won’t get in your way. The hoist has a compact design and can even be detached from its mounting bracket to free up your boot space. In daily life, this means you can still use your car’s boot for groceries, luggage or other items. The hoist arm can be removed or folded neatly out of the way.

    [text] => There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

    [text] => Inspired by Formula 1 engineering, the Trekinetic GTE weighs just 34kg with the battery, making it one of the lightest all-terrain powerchairs available. It’s easy to handle, simple to lift and far easier to transport than a traditional powered chair. With a top speed of 6km/h and a range of up to 30km, it’s built for freedom without the bulk.

    [text] => Conventional wheelchair seats can feel unstable on slopes, especially when heading downhill. The Trekinetic GTE solves this with a patented nitrogen gas shock absorber that adjusts the seat angle to match the terrain. It cushions every bump and crack while also working as a tilt-in-space system that shifts your weight for better balance. With this setup, the seat can move from fully upright to partially or fully reclined.

    [video] => 
    [text] => The Trekinetic GTE’s unique three wheel layout forms a stable triangular support base. Unlike conventional 4-wheel chairs, this geometry evenly distributes weight across all points, improving traction and balance. The design keeps the centre of gravity within the triangular frame therefore minimising tipping risk even on uneven ground. It’s a core part of what makes the GTE stable on hills, rough paths and off-road terrain.

    [text] => Inspired by Formula 1 engineering, the Trekinetic GTE weighs just 34kg with the battery, making it one of the lightest all-terrain powerchairs available. It’s easy to handle, simple to lift and far easier to transport than a traditional powered chair. With a top speed of 6km/h and a range of up to 30km, it’s built for freedom without the bulk.

    [text] => Conventional wheelchair seats can feel unstable on slopes, especially when heading downhill. The Trekinetic GTE solves this with a patented nitrogen gas shock absorber that adjusts the seat angle to match the terrain. It cushions every bump and crack while also working as a tilt-in-space system that shifts your weight for better balance. With this setup, the seat can move from fully upright to partially or fully reclined.

    [text] => The Trekinetic GTE’s unique three wheel layout forms a stable triangular support base. Unlike conventional 4-wheel chairs, this geometry evenly distributes weight across all points, improving traction and balance. The design keeps the centre of gravity within the triangular frame therefore minimising tipping risk even on uneven ground. It’s a core part of what makes the GTE stable on hills, rough paths and off-road terrain.

    [text] => The U-Step 2 is built for individuals with Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, stroke, brain injury, PSP, MSA and similar conditions. Its features are specifically designed to address symptoms like instability, freezing and fatigue where standard walkers often fall short. The patented U-shaped frame surrounds the user, providing consistent stability from all directions. Unlike typical walkers that offer limited support from the front, this design creates a wider, more supportive base that helps reduce falls and improve balance for people with neurological or mobility challenges.

    [video] => 
    [text] => With U-Step 2, the walker won’t move until you squeeze the hand brakes. This reverse brake design is safer for users with delayed reactions or difficulty maintaining grip. It is especially helpful when standing up, as the walker remains stationary until you're ready.

    [text] => Adjust the walker’s rolling speed to match your comfort and safety needs. The resistance dial lets you fine tune how easily the wheels rotate, helping prevent the walker from moving too quickly or unpredictably. This feature supports better control for users with balance or gait challenges.

    [text] => The U-Step 2 is built for individuals with Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, stroke, brain injury, PSP, MSA and similar conditions. Its features are specifically designed to address symptoms like instability, freezing and fatigue where standard walkers often fall short. The patented U-shaped frame surrounds the user, providing consistent stability from all directions. Unlike typical walkers that offer limited support from the front, this design creates a wider, more supportive base that helps reduce falls and improve balance for people with neurological or mobility challenges.

    [text] => The U-Step 2 is built for individuals with Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, stroke, brain injury, PSP, MSA and similar conditions. Its features are specifically designed to address symptoms like instability, freezing and fatigue where standard walkers often fall short. The patented U-shaped frame surrounds the user, providing consistent stability from all directions. Unlike typical walkers that offer limited support from the front, this design creates a wider, more supportive base that helps reduce falls and improve balance for people with neurological or mobility challenges.

    [text] => Inspired by Formula 1 engineering, the Trekinetic GTE weighs just 34kg with the battery, making it one of the lightest all-terrain powerchairs available. It’s easy to handle, simple to lift and far easier to transport than a traditional powered chair. With a top speed of 6km/h and a range of up to 30km, it’s built for freedom without the bulk.

    [text] => Conventional wheelchair seats can feel unstable on slopes, especially when heading downhill. The Trekinetic GTE solves this with a patented nitrogen gas shock absorber that adjusts the seat angle to match the terrain. It cushions every bump and crack while also working as a tilt-in-space system that shifts your weight for better balance. With this setup, the seat can move from fully upright to partially or fully reclined.

Unlike conventional 4-wheel chairs, this geometry evenly distributes weight across all points, improving traction and balance. The design keeps the centre of gravity within the triangular frame therefore minimising tipping risk even on uneven ground. It’s a core part of what makes the GTE stable on hills, rough paths and off-road terrain.

    [text] => The U-Step 2 is built for individuals with Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, stroke, brain injury, PSP, MSA and similar conditions. Its features are specifically designed to address symptoms like instability, freezing and fatigue where standard walkers often fall short. The patented U-shaped frame surrounds the user, providing consistent stability from all directions. Unlike typical walkers that offer limited support from the front, this design creates a wider, more supportive base that helps reduce falls and improve balance for people with neurological or mobility challenges.

    [text] => The U-Step 2 is built for individuals with Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, stroke, brain injury, PSP, MSA and similar conditions. Its features are specifically designed to address symptoms like instability, freezing and fatigue where standard walkers often fall short. The patented U-shaped frame surrounds the user, providing consistent stability from all directions. Unlike typical walkers that offer limited support from the front, this design creates a wider, more supportive base that helps reduce falls and improve balance for people with neurological or mobility challenges.

    [text] => The U-Step 2 is built for individuals with Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, stroke, brain injury, PSP, MSA and similar conditions. Its features are specifically designed to address symptoms like instability, freezing and fatigue where standard walkers often fall short. The patented U-shaped frame surrounds the user, providing consistent stability from all directions. Unlike typical walkers that offer limited support from the front, this design creates a wider, more supportive base that helps reduce falls and improve balance for people with neurological or mobility challenges.

    [text] => With U-Step 2, the walker won’t move until you squeeze the hand brakes. This reverse brake design is safer for users with delayed reactions or difficulty maintaining grip. It is especially helpful when standing up, as the walker remains stationary until you're ready.

    [text] => Adjust the walker’s rolling speed to match your comfort and safety needs. The resistance dial lets you fine tune how easily the wheels rotate, helping prevent the walker from moving too quickly or unpredictably. This feature supports better control for users with balance or gait challenges.
